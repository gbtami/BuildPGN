# MegaDatabase

## Introduction

While it is possible to purchase a <a href='https://shop.chessbase.com/en/products/mega_database_2016'>full chess game database</a> from Chessbase - it is expensive ($145 USD), it gets updated only once a year and it requires the Chessbase software to run. The project provides a workflow for building your own MegaDatabase for chess.

* Free and open-source
* Updated whenever you want
